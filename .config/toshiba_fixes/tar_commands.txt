tar commands:

1.    compress directory: tar cvfz archive.tar.gz directory/

2.   list contents: tar tvfz archive.tar.gz

3.    decompress archive: tar xvfz archive.tar.gz

v can be omitted if you don't like verbose output.

z can be omitted if you don't want compression.

j can be used instead of z if you want bzip2 compression instead of gzip
